+ What data would you need to collect?
+ How could you go about collecting that data? What kinds of sensors might you need?
+ How would you deploy your system? How often would it need to communicate? What kind of battery life would it need?
+ How might the data drift over time? How might you correct that?
+ How will you make sure your system protects peopleâ€™s privacy? Can you make sure it is secure?
