## Introduction to Using AI
Welcome back!  "Artificial Intelligence" is a term we hear a lot in conversationâ€”whether in the news, in school, or on the internet.  While it may *seem* like a mystery, that's probably just because you might be unfamiliar with the concept.  Artificial intelligence (AI) simply covers a range of techniques in computer science which make our computer systems appear to act with their own intelligence, on their own.  We call this **sentient behavior**.  We can relate the tasks that AI can do to things that we can do (often times *way* better) with our own human intelligence.

Tasks like **classification** and **prediction** when identifying objects, writing messages, or playing games can be imitated by AI.  We'll explore those and more, using some AI applications written by our friends at Google.

### Discussion
We'll move into smaller groups via breakout rooms in Zoom.  

> Use the following questions to discuss what you find with your fellow workshop members:
+ Do you think the AI did a good job?
+ Why do you think the AI did (or did not) work well?
+ How do you think the AI is working to solve this task?
+ What types of things were particularly hard or easy for the AI?
