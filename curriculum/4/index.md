Time flies when you're having fun!  (Time slows down 😖 when you're training your ML model.)  Believe it or not, today is our last day 🥺😭 together.

*Last time*, you discussed how ML could help your community, then you trained 👩🏽‍🏫 and launched 🚀 your own *custom* ML application!  *Today*, we'll talk about how this powerful technology can go wrong and how to responsibly design Artificial Intelligence.  At our last session in the afternoon, we'll have a panel of students from the Navajo Nation and elsewhere to talk about **what's next** for you on your journey to becoming a machine learning expert!  (**Teachers will meet separately** to discuss takeaways and how to implement ML modules in their high school courses.)
