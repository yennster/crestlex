Welcome back!  *Last time*, you learned about the power 💡of Artificial Intelligence!  

*Today*, we're going to talk all about **machine learning** (ML) to figure out just how that AI learns and classifies.  We'll start with the fundamentals, then in the afternoon, our friends from *Edge Impulse* will join us to help **you** deploy an ML application 📲to your phone!
