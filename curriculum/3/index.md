Can you believe it?  We're already halfway through our week-long workshop!  *Last time*, you learned the fundamentals of machine learning from the ground up.  

*Today*, in smaller groups, we're going to brainstorm ðŸ¤” how you could use machine learning to help **your own communities**.  Then, in the afternoon, our friends from *Edge Impulse* are back to help you take those ideas to create ðŸ›  your own *custom* ML app, designed just for you.
