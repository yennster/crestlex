>Click **[here](https://www.google.com)** to join our Zoom call.

CRESTLEX 3.0 is the first-of-its-kind, 1-week, hands-on/virtual course for high school **teachers** and **students** which will give you experience in developing a real-world application of ML through hands-on examples of Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML).  

This program is a collaboration among **Navajo Technical University**, **Harvard** John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, **Google**, and **Edge Impulse**.  CRESTLEX will be run virtually from June 22 to June 25, 2021. We look forward to exploring TinyML with you this summer.

<!-- TinyML is a cutting-edge field that brings the transformative power of machine learning (ML) to small low-power computing devices. This course will expose participants to the applications, algorithms, hardware, and software of TinyML.

*Are you curious about how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used to improve your everyday life? Do you ever wonder how your cell phone understands and responds to a question that you ask it? Have you heard the term Artificial Intelligence (AI), or Machine Learning (ML), but arenâ€™t sure about possible uses of ML or AI, or how you might prepare for a career in this field?*

Participants will learn how to use the [Edge Impulse platform](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/) to quickly and easily, collect data, train their own machine learning models, and deploy those models on their own mobile phones! -->
